# angular-oboe

This repo is for distribution on `bower`. 

WARNING: This is in a very early stage. NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION

Many thanks to Jim Higson for the oboe.js library.
See http://www.oboejs.com

## Install

### Try the example

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RonB/angular-oboe.git
cd angular-oboe
npm install
bower install
```
Now go to a browser and visit http://localhost:9000 


### Add module to your project using `bower`

```shell
bower install angular-oboe --save
```

Add a `<script>` to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular-oboe/angular-oboe.js"></script>
```

And add `ngOboe` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngOboe']);
```

## Usage

In your controller you add data to your scope by assingng the response of the Oboe service.
The servcie is called with an object that contains the parameters for the Oboe service. 
They  are the same as the oboe.js API [http://oboejs.com/api].
The pattern is added to the parameters to select JSON objects returned from the server.

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp')
    .controller(['$scope', 'Oboe', function($scope, Oboe) {
        $scope.myData = Oboe({url: '/api/myData', pattern: '{id}');
    }]);
```

## TODO:

This factory is in a very early stage.
Still to do:

* error handling
* test code
* documentation
* ability to add params to the xhr request
* create more examples
* talk to Jim Higson about some issues

Contributers to the project are very welcome!
