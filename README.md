# angular-oboe

This repo is for distribution on `bower`. 

WARNING: This is in a very early stage. NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION

Many thanks to Jim Higson for the terrific oboe.js library.
See [http://www.oboejs.com]

## Install

Install using `bower`:

```shell
bower install angular-oboe --save
```

Add a `<script>` to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular-oboe/angular-oboe.js"></script>
```

And add `ngOboe` as a dependency for your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngOboe']);
```

## Usage

In your controller you add data to your scope by assingng the response of the Oboe service.
The servcie is called with an object that contains the parameters for the Oboe service. 
They  are the same as the oboe.js API [http://oboejs.com/api].
The pattern is added to the parameters to select JSON objects returned from the server.

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp')
    .controller(['$scope', 'Oboe', function($scope, Oboe) {
        $scope.myData = Oboe({url: '/api/myData', pattern: '{id}');
    }]);
```

## Run the example
Make sure you have installed node.js, npm, bower and grunt.

In the bower_compenents/angular-oboe folder run:

    $ npm install
and 
    $ bower install 

Then run grunt

## TODO:

This factory is in a very early stage.
Still to do:

* error handling
* test code
* documentation
* talk to Jim Higson about several issues
* everything I didn't think of yet
* create better examples

Contributers to the project are very welcome!
